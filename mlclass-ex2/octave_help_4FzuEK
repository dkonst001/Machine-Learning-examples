Provide detailed information on currently defined variables matching the
given patterns.  Options and pattern syntax are the same as for the
@code{who} command.  Extended information about each variable is
summarized in a table with the following default entries.

@table @asis
@item Attr
Attributes of the listed variable.  Possible attributes are:
@table @asis
@item blank
Variable in local scope
@item @code{g}
Variable with global scope
@item @code{p}
Persistent variable
@end table
@item Name
The name of the variable.
@item Size
The logical size of the variable.  A scalar is 1x1, a vector is 1xN or Nx1,
a 2-D matrix is MxN.
@item Bytes
The amount of memory currently used to store the variable.
@item Class
The class of the variable.  Examples include double, single, char, uint16,
cell, and struct.
@end table

The table can be customized to display more or less information through
the function @code{whos_line_format}.

If @code{whos} is called as a function, return a struct array of defined
variable names matching the given patterns.  Fields in the structure
describing each variable are: name, size, bytes, class, global, sparse, 
complex, nesting, persistent.
